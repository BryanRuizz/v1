In addition, Swagger has been integrated to document the endpoints, facilitating the interaction with movies and users collections.

However, as it is a test project, no security features such as JWT or password hashing have been added. Even so, a clean architecture has been maintained, using the Singleton design pattern for the API service. With TypeScript as the main language, CRUD operations and basic alphabetical filters are implemented, although pagination or RxJS are not included, since the simplicity of the project does not require it.",

This was an important step in my training, as it allowed me to understand how logical solutions implemented in code can be translated into functional applications that users can easily interact with. Learning C# in combination with the terminal and Forms not only gave me a solid foundation in programming logic, but also taught me how to structure complete applications. This process not only strengthened my technical skills, but also made me understand the value of planning and design in software development.",
